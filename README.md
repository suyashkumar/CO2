</p>

Hello there! This is a hobby DIY project to build a carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring device. Indoor CO2 levels can be a proxy for ventilation, and there [might be negative cognitive impact for very high CO2 levels](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/27662232/4892924.pdf?sequence=1)--so it seems like a good thing to measure, and a fun excuse to make something. The plan is to get this data logged somewhere (locally, or over WiFi/Bluetooth/Serial) in addition to displaying the current levels on a small display, and maybe doing some fun analysis later (in addition to designing an enclosure, maybe battery powering this, etc). This is very much a work in progress, and we'll see where it goes!
